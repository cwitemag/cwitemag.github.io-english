**I'm willing to die for your lovely smile!**

You're like the moonlight in the veil of the night

For a lonely bird to travel a mile,

Sing some songs in the tranquil night

Oh, babe but that lovely smile..

<br>
I'm willing to die for your lovely smile!

You're a lighthouse that guides the ship in the majestic night

Lost in the recesses of the colossal ocean, oh that tragic ship

You solace that pitiful sailor, for your illumination

I have experienced bliss after a long while

Your smile glitters my face with joy and delight

I'm willing to die for your lovely smile!

<br>
Smiling face like a chubby cat,

Charming though like I fall flat

Dominate my thoughts like a plutocrat

I feel so happy when we chit-chat

I cannot be anymore a diplomat

I love you more than the stars above

I'm willing to die for your lovely smile!

<br>
