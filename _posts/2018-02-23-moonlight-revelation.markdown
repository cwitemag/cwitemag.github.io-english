**Moonlight Revelation**

Your gaze penetrates me like the moonlight. 

Serene, tranquil and calm just like the moonlight.

You bestow the vivacity of a rose; full of exuberance and euphoria

Like a moonlight solacing the existence with luminance

Thinking of you teleports me to Atlantis

In this world full of luxury and indulgence, I am fond of you.

I am passionate about you, I'm thunderstruck by you.

It's illogical, beyond logic from a higher realm of intuition. 

For It cannot apprehend enthusiasm and altruism.

My intuition whispered it's you, who makes me courageous and alive

Thinking of you I forget all my worries

There is no past nor future, just this indispensable moment of tremendous bliss

You keep me aware like a man on a cliff, solace me like a cocaine sniff

You're an antidote that cures me from numbness

But, babe your elegance and grandeur kills my saneness

A glimpse of you is precious than a diamond.

You're eyes have such a depth, more intense than a laser.

They are like a portal to another dimension full of bliss and euphoria. 

You're a gracious blend of vivacity and elegance.
