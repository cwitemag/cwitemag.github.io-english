**Talisman Jerry**

You are like a talisman, Jerry ;

Classic like blackberry;

Her presence is luminary;

She is not ordinary;

But legendary.

Just extra ordinary;

Her aims are revolutionary ;

She is a Happiness dictionary ;

You make everyone go crazy,

By the way you carry Yourself.

Just a beautiful and cute fairy

<br>
Sometimes you are January

Sometimes February 

You are just honorary 

Your aura is not temporary

You are a great visionary 

You are primarily sweet raspberry

Secondarily a great savour cherry
<br>

When you walk into the library

You be a addictive book like cantaberry

A placebo who blows my worry,

Rarely i never think of you,

I always miss you,

You are a living glory,

You are melodious than L.P(Linkin Park)'s Hybrid theory,

You make me forget the pivotal 

Game theory and Big bang theory
<br>

When to the inner force I do the enquiry

My inner voice whispers your name jerry

Your names are sweeter than heaven.
<br>

You have an indispensable place in my Memory 

It has a Little dictionary filled with your memories

Your beauty is expansionary,

Increasingly regularly,

Like a graph exponentially,

Your aura transcends me to a blissful stage which is Illusionary and imaginary

You are Inter disciplinary,

A blend of excellence and elegance
<br>

You cast a spell better than wizard Potter the Harry.

For times for my blunders i am sorry

Whenever my aims are blurry

So make me visionary

Your glimpse is vulnerary 

Than any military

Your make it look like your looks are greater

Than god aries
<br>

Lucky and fortunate is ur teddy
Jeleous of him

Cause its evolutionary 

When i query my mind i get the answer jerry and 

Remember the "hihihi" which is really like a fairy

None of the above is contrary,

Just i expressed my convictions altogether 

This is what i feel literary.
