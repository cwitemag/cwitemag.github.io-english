<p><strong>I’m willing to die for your lovely smile!</strong></p>

<p>You’re like the moonlight in the veil of the night</p>

<p>For a lonely bird to travel a mile,</p>

<p>Sing some songs in the tranquil night</p>

<p>Oh, babe but that lovely smile..</p>

<p><br />
I’m willing to die for your lovely smile!</p>

<p>You’re a lighthouse that guides the ship in the majestic night</p>

<p>Lost in the recesses of the colossal ocean, oh that tragic ship</p>

<p>You solace that pitiful sailor, for your illumination</p>

<p>I have experienced bliss after a long while</p>

<p>Your smile glitters my face with joy and delight</p>

<p>I’m willing to die for your lovely smile!</p>

<p><br />
Smiling face like a chubby cat,</p>

<p>Charming though like I fall flat</p>

<p>Dominate my thoughts like a plutocrat</p>

<p>I feel so happy when we chit-chat</p>

<p>I cannot be anymore a diplomat</p>

<p>I love you more than the stars above</p>

<p>I’m willing to die for your lovely smile!</p>

<p><br /></p>
