<p><strong>Moonlight Revelation</strong></p>

<p>Your gaze penetrates me like the moonlight.</p>

<p>Serene, tranquil and calm just like the moonlight.</p>

<p>You bestow the vivacity of a rose; full of exuberance and euphoria</p>

<p>Like a moonlight solacing the existence with luminance</p>

<p>Thinking of you teleports me to Atlantis</p>

<p>In this world full of luxury and indulgence, I am fond of you.</p>

<p>I am passionate about you, I’m thunderstruck by you.</p>

<p>It’s illogical, beyond logic from a higher realm of intuition.</p>

<p>For It cannot apprehend enthusiasm and altruism.</p>

<p>My intuition whispered it’s you, who makes me courageous and alive</p>

<p>Thinking of you I forget all my worries</p>

<p>There is no past nor future, just this indispensable moment of tremendous bliss</p>

<p>You keep me aware like a man on a cliff, solace me like a cocaine sniff</p>

<p>You’re an antidote that cures me from numbness</p>

<p>But, babe your elegance and grandeur kills my saneness</p>

<p>A glimpse of you is precious than a diamond.</p>

<p>You’re eyes have such a depth, more intense than a laser.</p>

<p>They are like a portal to another dimension full of bliss and euphoria.</p>

<p>You’re a gracious blend of vivacity and elegance.</p>
