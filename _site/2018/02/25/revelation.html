<p><strong>Revelation</strong></p>

<p>I smiled gazing at the moon</p>

<p>An epiphany occurred: Rose are made of diamonds</p>

<p>Besides a diamond a flower bloomed</p>

<p>A diamond will cherish the mood</p>

<p>but a flower cannot cure the gloom</p>

<p>What’s more valuable?</p>

<p>A crippled lifeless diamond or …</p>

<p>An alive and exuberant rose which blooms in the morning and withers by the evening</p>

<p>Love is like a fresh fragrant breeze that enters the home, fills it with freshness and fragrance, remains there as long as existence allow it, then moves out.</p>

<p>If you close all the doors the same breeze will become absolutely stale</p>

<p>In life everything is changing and change is beautiful</p>

<p>It gives you more experience, more awareness and more maturity</p>

<p>You bestow the vivacity of a rose; full of exuberance and euphoria</p>

<p>Like a moonlight solacing the existence with luminance</p>

<p>Thinking of you teleports me to Atlantis</p>

<p>Nothing fancy, just ordinary things about you</p>

<p>Right perspective converts stones into sermons</p>

<p>You’re like an antidote who blows away the melancholy</p>

<p>I don’t want possessions:</p>

<p>If you love a rose, don’t pluck it.</p>

<p>Love is not about possession, it’s about appreciation</p>

<p>With a little faith, just a little trust</p>

<p>if you believe in love, it can move mountains</p>

<p>An alchemy which can turn anything into gold like a Midas touch</p>

<p>Whenever I wanna quit, your thought keeps me going</p>

<p>You strengthen my endurance and keep me disciplined</p>

<p>The glimmer on your face is breath taking</p>

<p>The simplicity of your being is magnanimous</p>

<p>The vivacity of your soul is just par excellence!</p>

<p>It makes my intuition whispers, it’s you!</p>
